### Abstract
This repository contains a map image of counties in Missouri, colored by their 2016 estimated poverty rate. These data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2016 5-year American Community Survey estimates. I use this map in two units - teaching about class and also about low birth weight (part of the gender section of the course).
